          <h1>People are the Anchor.</h1>
          <p>
            If I've learned anything in my twenty years of existing, it's that
            the places you'll find yourself are only ever temporary. Homes, 
            belongings, and material possessions have come and gone, sometimes in
            the matter of seconds, throughout my life. My friends and my family
            are my dearest possessions, my reason for getting up in the morning, 
            my anchors. Life is nuts, but it's those you love along the way that
            make it worth it.
